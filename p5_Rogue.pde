Prototype RogueLike Engine in Processing
 
 multiple games against the clock
 - follow the white rabbit
 - retreive the items
 - get to the exit
 
 in the memories of an old woman, a young girl seeks objects to build memories
 
 SpriteBuilder builds sprites from vectors
 Doesnâ€™t use pixels
 
 Menu system, how to have it all on the keyboard?
 
 Sound system, ambience
 Sound by distance
 footsteps echo, but by how much? 
 
 how to measure the size of a room or a space?
 do tiles know how big the room they are in, is?
 how sound reflective are certain materials?
 
 access cursor with space
