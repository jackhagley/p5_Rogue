RogueLike

One of the first ideas for the RogueLike I had is that it was going to be cyberpunk.

The things that haven’t changed:
--Turn based
--Time sensitive game-play
---all actions take time, including inventory
--Minimal UI / No HUD
--Generative levels


Cyberpunk elements
--The City
    central idea in cyberpunk is a dystopian metropolis
--Technology
    Hacking
    Man/Machine Interface
    Unintended consequences

Story Elements
--Motivations
    push
        Death / Danger
        Hunger
    pull
        Rescue
        Exploration

Other Ideas
--Ecosystems are independent of Hero, you are a small part in a larger world
--Memory
--Limited Inventory Space
--Exploration
--Combat is secondary
--Leveling should be latent somehow, you improve by equipment
--The greater the challenge, the greater the rewards
--Levels have a time of day
--Mashup of themes as though different worlds are colliding
--Prone/knockdown
--Hit Points? How to show damage?

        - When the Zeds are after you, it is less important to be silent. You can hide in the shadows. The more that are after you, the more that will come.
